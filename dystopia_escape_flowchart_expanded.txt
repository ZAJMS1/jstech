SUCCESS ENDINGS
│
├─── SUCCESS ENDING 1: Resistance Extraction
│    "As the resistance aircraft rises above the city walls, you glimpse the sprawling dystopia
│    below for the last time. Your intel will help the resistance plan their next moves.
│    The fight isn't over, but you've escaped to fight another day."
│
├─── SUCCESS ENDING 2: Agricultural Zone
│    "Disguised as a farm worker, you cross the border checkpoint with the morning shift.
│    The open fields beyond the wall offer a new beginning. You can either disappear into
│    a new life or connect with resistance cells in the countryside."
│
├─── SUCCESS ENDING 3: Smuggler's Route
│    "The smuggler's ship creaks as it navigates away from the city's maritime border.
│    It's not comfortable, but it's freedom. You've made a deal to work passage to
│    the free territories, where your skills will be valuable – and unregulated."
│
├─── SUCCESS ENDING 4: Inside Job
│    "Your new identity papers, courtesy of the sympathetic official, pass every
│    inspection point with flying colors. Sometimes corruption works in favor of justice.
│    You board the diplomatic transport with a mixture of guilt and relief."
│
└─── SUCCESS ENDING 5: Digital Ghost
     "As you upload your consciousness to the satellite network, your physical body
     becomes irrelevant. The regime can control the streets, but not the global datastream.
     Your digital escape represents a new form of resistance they never anticipated."

FAILURE ENDINGS
│
├─── DEATH/CAPTURE ENDING 1: Traced Signal
│    "The extraction point is suspiciously empty when you arrive. Too late, you realize
│    the transmission was compromised. Patrol spotlights converge on your position as
│    the sound of boots surrounds you on all sides."
│
├─── DEATH/CAPTURE ENDING 2: Failed Checkpoint
│    "The officer's face changes as your forged ID fails the advanced scan. Before you
│    can react, security barriers slam into place. The holding cells await, followed by
│    intensive interrogation that will extract everything you know."
│
├─── DEATH/CAPTURE ENDING 3: Tunnel Collapse
│    "The rumbling starts as a distant vibration but quickly becomes a roar. The regime
│    must have detected tunnel activity and triggered the collapse charges. In the darkness,
│    there's nowhere to run as tons of concrete and earth descend."
│
├─── DEATH/CAPTURE ENDING 4: Betrayed
│    "The 'ally' smiles apologetically as the patrol surrounds you. 'It's nothing personal,'
│    they say, pocketing their reward chit, 'but the regime pays better than the resistance.'
│    Some people can't be trusted, even in the darkest times."
│
└─── DEATH/CAPTURE ENDING 5: The Chase
     "You've evaded them for hours, but the drone swarm finally has your heat signature
     cornered. As their spotlights blind you and stun rounds immobilize your muscles,
     you realize the regime's technology was always going to win this uneven race."
